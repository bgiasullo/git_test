- 👋 Hi, I’m Briana
- 👀 I’m interested in archives, literature, and way too many other things in the world.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about healthcare informatics and I'm expecially curious about how healthcare informatics can perpetuate social biases when providing health interventions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building digital collections of random things, like snowmen or birdhouses.
